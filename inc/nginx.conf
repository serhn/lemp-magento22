## Example configuration:
upstream fastcgi_backend {
    # use tcp connection
    # server  127.0.0.1:9000;
    # or socket
    server php_mag:9000;
 }
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;
    set $MAGE_ROOT /usr/share/nginx;
    include /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.inc;
}
#
## Optional override of deployment mode. We recommend you use the
## command 'bin/magento deploy:mode:set' to switch modes instead.
##
## set $MAGE_MODE default; # or production or developer
##
## If you set MAGE_MODE in server config, you must pass the variable into the
## PHP entry point blocks, which are indicated below. You can pass
## it in using:
##
## fastcgi_param  MAGE_MODE $MAGE_MODE;
##
## In production mode, you should uncomment the 'expires' directive in the /static/ location block
